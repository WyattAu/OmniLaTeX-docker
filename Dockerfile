# The `minted` LaTeX package provides syntax highlighting using the Python `pygmentize`
# package. That package also installs a callable script, which `minted` uses, see
# https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/281152/120853.
# Therefore, `minted` primarily works by invoking `pygmentize` (or whatever it was
# overridden by using `\MintedPygmentize`). However, it requires `python` for other
# jobs, e.g. to remove leading whitespace for the `autogobble` function, see the
# "\minted@autogobble Remove common leading whitespace." line in the docs.
# It is invoked with `python -c`, but Debian only has `python3`. Therefore, alias
# `python` to invoke `python3`. Use `update-alternatives` because it's cooler than
# symbolic linking, and made for this purpose.
# If `python` is not available but `pygmentize` is, stuff like `autogobble` and
# `\inputminted`won't work but syntax highlighting will.
